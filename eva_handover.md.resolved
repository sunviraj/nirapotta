# Project Nirapotta V3: Handover for Eva

## 1. Current Project Status (Everything is Fine!)
The App is stable and the data collection phase is **100% complete**.
- **Sensors**: Both the Accelerometer and Microphone are actively listening and successfully detecting spikes (Shake, Impact, Loud Noise).
- **Data Pipeline**: The [SensorDataRepository](file:///c:/Users/User/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/shake_alert_app/lib/data/sensor_repository.dart#9-110) is flawlessly combining the motion and sound data into unified CSV matrices using a Zero-Order Hold algorithm.
- **Evidence**: The app automatically captures silent background photos during Major Alerts.
- **UI & Flow**: The entire Onboarding flow, Hardware Calibration, and Dashboard have been successfully designed with a modern Glassmorphism aesthetic.
- **Labeling**: The CSV datasets are automatically labeled based on the trigger context (e.g., `IMPACT_DETECTED` vs. `LOUD_NOISE`).

## 2. Your Datasets
The user has successfully collected the necessary datasets for the AI model. Because of the automated labeling implemented in Phase 5, the CSV files provided to you are already categorized. 

## 3. Your Tasks (What to do Next)

### Task A: Machine Learning / Model Training (Primary)
Now that you have the raw CSV datasets, your first objective is to train the AI model.
1. **Upload**: Import the provided CSV datasets into the training platform (e.g., Edge Impulse).
2. **Train**: Use the generated groups (`IMPACT`, `LOUD_NOISE`, `SHAKE`) to train a classification model that can accurately distinguish between a real emergency and regular phone movements.
3. **Export**: Once the model is trained and verified, export the TensorFlow/TFLite model so it can be integrated back into our Flutter app later.

### Task B: The Alert Decision System (The Logic Gate)
Currently, the app triggers alerts based on simple hard thresholds. You need to implement the complex decision matrix that categorizes these incidents.
- Define what constitutes a **Minor Alert** vs a **Major Alert** based on the model's output or combined sensor logic.
    - *Example*: `Minor Shake` = Local Notification.
    - *Example*: `Minor Shake` followed by `Loud Noise` within 5 seconds = Escalate immediately to `Major Alert`.

### Task C: Repository Management (Git Master)
- You act as the gatekeeper for the [main](file:///c:/Users/User/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/shake_alert_app/test/widget_test.dart#13-31) branch.
- Shortly, **Sifat** will be completing the GPS Location Tracking and SMS/Call emergency dispatch modules. 
- It is your responsibility to review Sifat's code, ensure it integrates perfectly with your "Logic Gate", and safely merge it into the main repository.
